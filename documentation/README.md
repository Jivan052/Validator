## Project Overview

ValidateIt is a web application built to help entrepreneurs validate their business ideas using AI analysis and market data. The platform integrates with Google's Gemini AI and NewsAPI to provide comprehensive insights about business ideas, including market potential, sentiment analysis, risk assessment, and execution recommendations.

**Key Features:**
- Single Sign-On with Google authentication
- AI-powered keyword extraction from business ideas
- Integration with news APIs for market research
- AI analysis of business viability, risks, and opportunities
- Visual data representations with charts and metrics
- Follow-up Q&A capabilities with contextual understanding
- Secure data storage with optimized database access

## System Architecture

ValidateIt follows a client-side architecture built primarily with:

- **Frontend Framework**: React (v19.1.1) with Vite for fast development
- **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS for responsive design
- **Authentication & Database**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **External APIs**: 
  - Google Gemini AI API for idea analysis
  - NewsAPI for relevant market news

The system is designed with a component-based architecture for maintainability, with services abstracted into dedicated modules for API communication and business logic.

## Installation & Setup

See [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md) for complete setup instructions.

## Core Services

ValidateIt is built around several key service modules:

### Firestore Service
Handles all database operations for storing and retrieving user ideas, analyses, and question counts. Implements optimized caching to reduce database reads/writes.

### Gemini Service
Manages communication with the Google Gemini AI API for:
- Keyword extraction from idea descriptions
- Comprehensive business idea analysis
- Follow-up question answering with context

### News API Service
Fetches relevant news articles based on keywords extracted from the business idea. Provides current market data for the AI analysis.

### Secure Storage Utility
Implements secure client-side storage using cookies with encryption, replacing localStorage for enhanced security.

See [SERVICES.md](./SERVICES.md) for detailed documentation on each service.

## Authentication System

ValidateIt uses Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In as the sole authentication method. The authentication flow is managed through a central AuthContext that provides authentication state and methods throughout the application.

See [AUTHENTICATION.md](./AUTHENTICATION.md) for detailed documentation on the authentication system.

## Database Structure

ValidateIt uses Firebase Firestore as its database with the following collection structure:

- **users**: Stores user information and question count limits
- **ideas**: Stores business ideas, analysis results, and follow-up questions

See [DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md) for detailed schema information and best practices.

## Component Documentation

ValidateIt is built with reusable React components organized by functionality:

- **Authentication Components**: Login
- **Page Components**: Home, Dashboard, IdeaDetails, NewIdea
- **UI Components**: Navbar, PrivateRoute
- **Chart Components**: Various data visualization components
- **Form Components**: RequestMoreQuestionsForm

See [COMPONENTS.md](./COMPONENTS.md) for detailed component documentation.

## API Integration

ValidateIt integrates with several external APIs:

- **Google Gemini AI**: For natural language processing and idea analysis
- **NewsAPI**: For fetching relevant news articles
- **Firebase APIs**: For authentication and database operations

See [API_INTEGRATION.md](./API_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed API documentation.

## Security & Best Practices

ValidateIt implements several security measures:

- **Secure Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with Google OAuth
- **Secure Storage**: Cookie-based encrypted storage instead of localStorage
- **Data Validation**: Input validation across all user inputs
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of API keys
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Optimized Database Access**: Caching and batching to reduce Firestore operations

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for detailed security documentation.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Analysis Getting Stuck**: Usually related to Gemini API limitations or quota issues
2. **Authentication Issues**: Typically related to Firebase configuration
3. **Missing News Articles**: Often caused by NewsAPI limitations or keyword quality

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed troubleshooting guides.
